# GoT CountDown Timer
I am a huge fan of Game of Thrones and I always had a mental calculation to estimate the time remaining for the next episode. I thought it'd be cool to
create a chrome extension that gives you a countdown timer for the next episode.

After each episode, the countdown timer in the chrome extension will automatically reset for the upcomming week.

Currently, the timer does not expire which means that after the last episode is done, the counter will again reset to the next week.

I am a beginner in creating Chrome extensions and I thought it'd be a great beginning project to start with.
## Installation
The installation is very simple. 
1. Please clone or download the root file
2. Open Google Chrome and open extensions from settings.
You can also open the extensions by this url
```bash
chrome://extensions/
```
3. Clicked on load unpacked and select the root file of manifest.json
4. You will have the extension loaded. Click on the dragon icon on your chrome toolbar
